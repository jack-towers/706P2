To do list:
1. CAD model mounts for robot: In progress
2. Kalman Filters for IR sensors: NO
3. Finite State Machine
4. Obstacle Avoidance System
5. Wire the fan: Done
6. Servo motor Calibration: Donezo
7. Make Code for moving the servo and detecting the fire
8. Make the circuit for phototransistors
9. Calibrate phototransistors, use 10 or 12 ohms
10. Adjust Cruise and Follow functions to include twisting the servo and finding the fire
11. Consider using 2 Phototransistors forward and 2 back to cover 360 degrees
