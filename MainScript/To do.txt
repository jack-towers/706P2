To do list:
1. CAD model mounts for robot: In progress
2. Kalman Filters for IR sensors: NO
3. Finite State Machine
4. Obstacle Avoidance System
5. Wire the fan: Done
6. Servo motor Calibration: Donezo
7. Make Code for moving the servo and detecting the fire
8. Make the circuit for phototransistors: Done
9. Calibrate phototransistors, use 10k or 12k ohms, currently using 12k ohms
10. Adjust Cruise and Follow functions to include twisting the servo and finding the fire
11. Consider using 2 Phototransistors forward and 2 back to cover 360 degrees

Replace Cruise function with spinning in a circle until we find the fire
